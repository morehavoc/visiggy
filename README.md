# Visiggy - AI Image Guessing Game

Visiggy is a real-time, multiplayer party game where an AI generates bizarre images from quirky prompts, and players race to guess the original prompt. It's like a creative fusion of Pictionary and Dixit, powered by AI.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or later)
*   npm
*   Access to OpenAI API and a custom image generation endpoint.

### 2. Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/visiggy.git
    cd visiggy
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying the example, then fill in your API keys and endpoints.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Your `.env` file should look like this:
    ```
    PORT=3000
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
    CUSTOM_AI_ENDPOINT=https://your-image-gen-api.com
    CUSTOM_AI_AUTH=your-auth-token
    ROOMS_FILE=rooms.json
    ```

### 3. Running the Application

## üïπÔ∏è Game Flow

1.  **Room Creation**: A host creates a new game and receives a 6-character room code to share.
2.  **Teams Join**: Players join the room using the code and choose a team name.
3.  **Game Start**: The host selects the number of rounds, an optional theme, and starts the game.
4.  **Round Cycle**:
    *   The server pre-fetches a prompt from GPT-4o and requests an image from the custom API.
    *   While players wait, a joke is fetched from GPT-4o and displayed.
    *   The round begins with a 3-second countdown, revealing the AI-generated image.
    *   A 60-second timer starts, and teams submit their guesses for the original prompt.
    *   The round ends when the timer is up or all teams have guessed.
    *   GPT-4o scores each guess based on its similarity to the prompt, and points are awarded.
    *   The results, prompt, and updated leaderboard are displayed.
5.  **Game Over**: After the final round, a game over screen shows the final leaderboard and a gallery of all images from the game.

## üîå WebSocket API

The client and server communicate over a WebSocket connection using JSON messages with a `type` field.
